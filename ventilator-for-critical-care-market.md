<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventilator for Critical Care Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The critical care ventilator market is primarily categorized into two types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators are designed for patients who require assistance with breathing through intubation, allowing direct airway access for more effective ventilation in severe cases. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, provide respiratory support without the need for intubation, using masks or nasal interfaces, making them suitable for patients with less severe respiratory issues. Both types are essential for managing respiratory failure in critical care settings.</p></p>
