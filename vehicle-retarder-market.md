<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Retarder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric retarders</li><li>Hydraulic retarder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle retarder market comprises two main types: electric and hydraulic retarders. Electric retarders utilize electromagnetic principles, generating resistance that slows down the vehicle without relying on friction, resulting in lower heat generation and maintenance costs. In contrast, hydraulic retarders operate using oil flow to create resistance, which effectively dissipates energy during braking. Both systems enhance vehicle safety and efficiency by providing additional braking power, particularly in heavy-duty trucks and buses, allowing for smoother deceleration and reduced wear on traditional brakes.</p></p>
