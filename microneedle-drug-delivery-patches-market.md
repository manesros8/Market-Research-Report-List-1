<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microneedle Drug Delivery Patches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dissolving Type</li><li>Insoluble Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microneedle drug delivery patches are innovative systems designed to deliver medications through the skin. The market is categorized into two main types: dissolving and insoluble microneedles. Dissolving microneedles disintegrate upon application, releasing the drug directly into the body, enhancing bioavailability and reducing pain. Insoluble microneedles, on the other hand, remain intact after penetration, serving as a conduit for drug delivery via diffusion or other methods. Both types offer significant advantages over traditional injection methods, including improved patient compliance and convenience.</p></p>
