<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intraocular Lens (IOLs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-foldable lenses</li><li>Foldable Intraocular Lens</li><li>Hydrophilic</li><li>Hydrophobic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intraocular lens (IOL) market is categorized primarily into two types: non-foldable and foldable lenses. Non-foldable lenses are rigid and typically require larger incisions for implantation. Foldable IOLs, on the other hand, can be inserted through smaller incisions, enhancing patient recovery. Within these categories, IOLs are further divided into hydrophilic and hydrophobic lenses. Hydrophilic lenses, made from water-absorbing materials, offer high biocompatibility, while hydrophobic lenses, which resist water, enhance optical clarity and reduce complications.</p></p>
