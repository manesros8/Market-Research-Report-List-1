<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-phthalate Catalysts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Supported Catalyst</li><li>Unsupported Catalyst</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-phthalate catalysts market comprises two main types: supported and unsupported catalysts. Supported catalysts are those that are affixed to a solid support material, enhancing their stability and activity, often used to facilitate diverse chemical reactions efficiently. Unsupported catalysts, on the other hand, are not bound to any support and rely solely on their intrinsic properties for catalysis. Both types are crucial in various industrial applications, particularly in producing eco-friendly alternatives to phthalate-based chemicals, promoting sustainability in manufacturing processes.</p></p>
